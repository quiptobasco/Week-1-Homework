# Week-1-Homework - Code Refactoring

## Description:

The main purpose of this project is to refactor exisiting code for a company's website to increase accessability.  By changing the ` HTML ` tags to be semantic and adding ` alt ` text to images it allows those with disabilities to use technologies like screen readers to be able to better navigate a page.  **More** accessability means **more** customers, which means **more** business!
